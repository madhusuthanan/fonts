		The font family of a text is set with the font-family property.
		The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font.
		Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note: If the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".
		More than one font family is specified in a comma-separated list:

	<h1>CSS font-family</h1>
		<p class="serif">This is a paragraph, shown in the Times New Roman font.</p>
		<p class="sansserif">This is a paragraph, shown in the Arial font.</p>
